#### Parameters
Name | Description
---- | -----------
Title | The title of the recipient. For example, `Mr`, `Mrs`, `Ms`, but not limited to anything
Firstname | The first name of the recipient
Lastname | The last name of the recipient 
MobileNumber | A valid mobile number for the recipient
EmailAddress | An optional email address for the recipient
User{n} | Ten optional user fields that can be used for anything. Up to 2014 characters in length.
When | A date and time that can be used to control when their invite is sent out if the recipient list is connected to a survey
LookupTest | A boolean value indicating whether the recipient's mobile number should be checked. If it is not a mobile number then it will be rejected and added to the error report.


#### Duplication Testing
It is possible to stop duplicate recipients being added to a recipient list. The checks are done against the existing
list of recipients in the list and the new ones being added. The following describes the parameters that can be
supplied in the optional `Duplication` parameter.

##### Fields
A list of fields separated by a comma that refer should be checked for duplication. These can be any from the following list:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
tel | Mobile number
email | Email address
firstname | The first name of the recipient
lastname | The last name of the recipient
title | The title of the recipient
user{n} | the user fields from 1 to 10

These fields are used to look for existing recipients and if there is a match this will result in a duplcation error.

##### Date & Limit
The name of a field as listed in the `Fields` parameter that can be used to check against as a date.
The limit is the number of days that the must be the difference between today and the date in the field before the recipient is not considered to be a duplicate.
This supports that idea of adding recipients only if they have not been contacted in the last so many days.

##### GenerateDate
A boolean value that indicates whether the `Date` field should be updated by this process when the recipient is successfully added.
This provides the ability for this process to maintain the Date field itself rather than you having to maintain it
in your data.


#### Returns
If there were errors adding the recipients then a list of errors as an array of strings. For example:
```
{
  "Errors":["Error 1", "Error 2"]
}
```
If a look request was made then a list of these errors are also included.
If there duplication errors then a list of recipients that are dupolicated are return.
If there was no problem then the following in returned:
```
{
  "Status": "Success"
}
```
